## About

As a photographer I needed a place to host my work (and sell prints in the future). I was using squarespace before and felt that I was limited by their offering.
Frustrated I decided to build my own website, and this is how I actually got into web development.

This is a refactored a rebuilt version of the my first build. Mobile users have been taken into account,add now there is a print store which is powered by Stripe.
